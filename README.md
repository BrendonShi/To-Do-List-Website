It is a simple, effective productivity tool built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Sqlite3 database. It allows you to schedule specific time blocks and plays a custom alarm sound at the start and end of every task.

All schedules are automatically saved to a sqlite3 database.

## Prerequisites
You need **Python** installed on your computer.

## Installation

## Customization

### Changing the Alarm Sound

2.  Rename the file to `alarm.mp3`.

### Resetting the Database
If you want to clear all tasks or if you encounter database errors after changing the code:
1.  Stop the server (Ctrl+C).
2.  Delete the `schedule.db` file in the project folder.
3.  Restart the server (`python app.py`). A new, empty database will be created.
